# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer

There are three ways you can use a dependency array with useEffect. You can use `useEffect` without a dependency array, which will trigger an effect per every render on the component.

```jsx
const MyComponent...{

  useEffect(effect) //... <- will cause an effect to happen every time "MyComponent" is hit
  
}
```

Have a dependency array but leave it empty, which will trigger an effect only once.

```jsx
const MyComponent...{

  useEffect(effect, []) //<- the effect will only be triggered once, even if "MyComponent" were to re-rendered

}
```

And lastly, you can have values inside of the dependency array, the effect will be triggered only if the values in the array changes between renders.

```js
const MyComponent...{

  useEffect(effect, [valueA, valueB]) // <- if the values were to change, the effect will take place

}
```
